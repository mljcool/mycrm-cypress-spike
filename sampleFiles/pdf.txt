Your Broker

Hi Matthew AXXs & Kelley RXXXXXXs,

Thank you for this opportunity to help you achieve your goals - I'm excited to go on this
journey with you!

What you can expect from me. I'm your personal negotiator with at least 20 lenders. My
focus is on finding and presenting you with options that meet your current needs, keeping
the process simple, and importantly, helping you reach your financial goals.

Your personalised Game Plan features a range of competitive options for your new loan
(based on your current financial situation). It outlines:

what we have discussed; the information provided by you on your requirements,
objectives and goals
what I recommend; and why I believe these recommendations are in your best
interests
what it will cost you; we are transparent so any fees, commissions, interest or
charges relating to the products and services are laid out for you to see

What's next? Take some time to review these options and understand what it means to
proceed. I'm here to answer all your questions. Once you're ready to proceed, I'll prepare
your loan application ready for your review, approval, and signature. I'll then submit your
application and let you know the moment it's approved by the lender.

I'm just a phone call or email away for any questions you may have.

Terms, disclaimers, and acknowledgements

This Game Plan* includes a recommendation for a lender and a specific product

The recommendation in this Game Plan has been prepared by your Mortgage Broker under Responsible Lending laws as part of the National Consumer
Credit Protection Act 2009 (the National Credit Act). The National Credit Act provides legal protection for consumers when seeking credit assistance,
like receiving a product recommendation from a Mortgage Broker.

Responsible Lending requires your Mortgage Broker to make an assessment that any recommended loan is �not unsuitable�. In making this
assessment Mortgage Brokers have an obligation to:

1. make reasonable inquiries about your financial situation and requirements, including your goals, objectives and preferences
2. take reasonable steps to verify your current financial situation; and
3. make a preliminary assessment on the suitability of this product for you and provide this in writing.

This Game Plan is your Mortgage Broker�s preliminary assessment of the suitability of the product for you.

* Note this Game Plan is valid for 90 days from signature date. Information on loan products is supplied by lenders and is subject to frequent changes
(ie as interest rates change). Any material changes will be raised with you by your Mortgage Broker and may result in a revised Game Plan.

The information you have provided to your Mortgage Broker

By signing this Customer Acknowledgement and Declaration you are confirming that you have checked the information you provided is accurately
represented in the Game Plan and as far as you know there are no omissions or inaccuracies.

The information used in the Game Plan has been recorded and used in accordance with information provided by you. You should check the
information in your Game Plan for any inaccuracies and/or omissions (including any foreseeable changes) which may impact on your ability to meet
loan repayments in the future and advise your broker immediately as this may alter the assessment and recommendation.

Agreeing to this recommendation instructs your Mortgage Broker to apply for the loan

By signing this Customer Acknowledgement and Declaration you are instructing your Mortgage Broker to proceed to lodge a loan with the
recommended lender and product.

Some important things to note as you move forward to lodging a loan application:

A loan is a credit contract with the lender, you should read the details carefully before signing, checking that it matches your requirements
Your Mortgage Broker represents you and has obligations to the Lenders This means not to provide any information we or you know is
misleading or deceptive. We also have obligations under the law to report any fraud, forgery, or other illegal activities. By signing this
agreement you confirm that you understand that we have these obligations to the lender and under the law. If you have any questions about
our role, ask before you sign.

We do not provide legal and/or financial advice, unless specified in a separate contract. Accordingly, it is important you ensure you understand your
legal obligations under the loan, and the financial consequences. If you have any doubts, you should obtain independent legal and financial advice. We
do not determine or recommend the conditions of the credit contract (such as interest rates, fees, or the term of the loan).

We confirm the process to produce and lodge the loan application will be commenced immediately following your confirmation. This will include the
provision of information that you have provided to us and that we have collated, information obtained in accordance with your consent from external
parties ie credit history, financial statements, contracts of sale and any other related or Lender requested documentation.
